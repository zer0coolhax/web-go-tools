# Go Tools Installer

A simple script to install and configure Go along with popular security and reconnaissance tools. 

Note: Some of the Go tools listed can also be installed via the Kali repo by using `apt install toolName`. Installing using the `go install` method installs the tool that might have not been fully tested like the Kali version of the tool but might offer the newest version or new features not yet released on Kali.

## Features

- Installs Go (if not already installed)
- Configures Go environment variables in your `.zshrc`
- Installs selected Go tools from `tools.txt`
- Command-line flag based options for flexible installation
- Automatic tool updates with version checking
- Tool removal with optional Go uninstallation

## Prerequisites

- Linux-based operating system
- `wget` for downloading Go
- `sudo` privileges for installing Go
- zsh shell

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zer0coolhax/web-go-tools.git
   cd web-go-tools
   ```

2. Make the installer executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install.sh
   ```

3. Run the installer with desired options:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh [OPTIONS]
   ```

## Usage

The installer provides the following command-line options:

```
Options:
  -a, --all           Install everything (Go + Environment + Tools)
  -g, --go            Install Go only
  -e, --env           Setup Go environment only
  -t, --tools         Install Go tools only
  -u, --update        Check and update tools if needed
  -r, --remove        Remove installed tools and optionally Go
  -h, --help          Display help message
```

### Examples

```bash
# Install everything
./install.sh --all

# Install tools only
./install.sh --tools

# Install Go and setup environment
./install.sh -g -e

# Check and update tools if needed
./install.sh --update

# Remove tools and optionally Go
./install.sh --remove

# Show help
./install.sh --help
```

## Tool Updates

The script includes functionality to automatically check and update tools:

```bash
./install.sh --update
```

This will:
1. Check each installed tool against its latest version
2. Display current and latest versions
3. Automatically update any tools that need updating
4. Show a summary of the update process

Example output:
```
Checking github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder...
assetfinder is up to date (version: v0.1.1)

Checking github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe...
httprobe has an update available:
  Current: v0.1.2
  Latest:  v0.1.3

Updating tools that need updates...
Updating github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe@latest...
All updates completed!
```

## Tool Removal

The script includes functionality to remove installed tools and optionally Go:

```bash
./install.sh --remove
```

This will:
1. Remove all tools listed in `tools.txt` from your Go workspace
2. Ask if you want to remove Go as well
3. If Go removal is selected:
   - Remove the Go binary
   - Clean up Go environment variables from `.zshrc`
   - Remove the Go workspace
   - Prompt to restart terminal or source `.zshrc`

Example output:
```
Removing installed tools...
Removing assetfinder...
Removing httprobe...
Removing gowitness...
All tools have been removed!

Do you want to remove Go as well? (y/N): y
Removing Go...
Go has been removed!
Please restart your terminal or run 'source ~/.zshrc' to apply changes.
```

## Included Tools

The following tools are included in the installation:

- [assetfinder](https://github.com/tomnomnom/assetfinder) - Find domains and subdomains
- [httprobe](https://github.com/tomnomnom/httprobe) - Take a list of domains and probe for working HTTP and HTTPS servers
- [gowitness](https://github.com/sensepost/gowitness) - A web screenshot utility using Chrome Headless

## Important Note About Package Managers

While some of these tools are available through package managers (like apt), this installer provides the following advantages:

1. **Latest Versions**: The tools are installed directly from their source repositories, ensuring you get the most recent features and bug fixes.
2. **Automatic Updates**: The update checker automatically updates tools that need updating.
3. **Consistent Installation**: All tools are installed in your Go workspace, making them easier to manage and update.
4. **Version Checking**: The update checker helps you stay informed about available updates.
5. **Easy Removal**: Tools can be easily removed with a single command, with the option to remove Go as well.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Ensure you have the required permissions
2. Check if Go is properly installed: `go version`
3. Verify your Go environment: `echo $GOPATH`
4. Make sure your `.zshrc` is properly sourced: `source ~/.zshrc`
